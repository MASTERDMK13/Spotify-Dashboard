# Spotify-Dashboard
Engineered an interactive dashboard to process complex global song datasets, identifying a critical correlation between declining track duration and chart performance to highlight shifting user engagement trends.
Headline: The Science of a Hit: Decoding Global Music Trends

The Story (The "Why"): The music industry is shifting rapidly. I was curious: has the rise of TikTok and short-form content actually changed the structure of popular music? I analyzed a complex global dataset of top songs to find out.

The Solution: I engineered an interactive Power BI dashboard to process global song attributes (danceability, energy, duration) and compare them against chart performance.

Key Insights: The "Attention Span" Shift: I discovered a critical correlation: track duration has been steadily declining among top-charting songs.
Engagement Trends: This insight highlights a major shift in user engagement—modern listeners reward shorter, punchier tracks, a trend that directly impacts how artists should structure their music for commercial success.
